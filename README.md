# AirBnB_Price_in_Austin_Regression


This repository contains the dataset obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/airbnb-property-data-from-texas. As a team of four, we cleaned and reshaped the original dataset and performed exploratory analysis to identify trends and insight on prices. Then, we built a regression model (logistic) with 54 predictors and reported on the results.

This repository contains the code for data cleaning, reshaping, visualization, and the regression model.
