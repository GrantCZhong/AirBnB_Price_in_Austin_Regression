The bathroom is in the hallway and would be a shared bath with whomever stays in the 2nd guest room (if any). Otherwise, it's all yours. \n\nThe room has central air/heat and I also have a ceiling fan and a small space heater/fan for your own temperature control within the room.

Luxurious and quiet. It is inhabited by deer, raccoon, rabbits, owls, lizards and butterflies. There is an old stone well filled by an aquifer (legend states the well was built by Ben McCullough; the civil war hero). A large back yard is used for walks, bonfires and golfing/batting balls. Lounge in the dappled sun on the patio near a running pond surrounded with gardens. Prepare a leisurely bar-b-que. Talk late into the night by the fire pit. \n\nThis 100+ yr old cabin has been revived and furnished with love. Time seems to stop while soaking in the deep old claw tub filled with endless hot spring water . Drifting to sleep, become aware of crackling in the wood burning stove, a train whistle and the trickling pond. Breakfast choices are street tacos or waffles...with pecans? \n\nIts possible you'll be tempted to stay all day. However, the center of Austin or San Marcos, with music, swimming, fishing and kayaking are just 15-25 minutes from this retreat. \nSound like a fit for you?
